            <p>Chiken is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). Chickens are one of the most common and 
                widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018. up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are 
                more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming 
                both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were 
                not kept for food until the Hellenistic period.</p>
